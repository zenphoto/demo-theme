### demo_theme-basic-files
This is a basic theme that is meant as a starting point to write your own. These are the standard theme files/pages any theme should have as a minimum. 

The HTML included is stripped to the absolute minimum so the basic structure is more clear. 

Note that this demo theme is not setup for a theme based translation. 

### demo_theme-zenpage-cms-extras-files

These are extra theme files/pages a theme needs to provide support for the [Zenpage CMS plugin](http://www.zenphoto.org/news/zenpage-a-cms-plugin-for-zenphoto/)  and its news articles (blog) and pages management capabilities.

The `search.php` page is an extended one for returning news article and page results and needed to replace the version from the "basic files".
